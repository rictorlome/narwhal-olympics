# whale-olympics

## Background

Whale Olympics is a one player adventure game based on the timeless classic Dolphin Olympics 2. The general idea of the game is to perform aerial acrobatics such as flipping and rolling while breaching the surface of the water. The gameplay increases in intensity as the whale picks up in speed and achieves greater altitudes in the air.

## Functionality & MVP

The gameplay of Whale Olympics will allow users to:
- Control the direction and speed of the whale using the arrow keys.
- Get the whale to spin by holding down the down button.
- Collect points based on the combination and smooth landing of different aerial tricks

In addition, the project will feature:
- A production README
- An instructions page
- A free swim mode without a clock

## Architecture and Technologies

The main resources I intend to draw upon are: vanilla JavaScript, specifically the canvas functionality, HTML and CSS, and some sprite libraries. Following the principles of Object Oriented Design, I will probably decompose the file and class structure into main components such as: the whale, the ocean, the sky, the background, auxiliary marine-life, and a landing page. I will use webpack to bundle these files up.

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1
- Full day of Canvas.
- Block out ocean and sky.
- Block out whale.
- Attempt to get whale to respond to directions.
### Day 2
- Begin styling whale.
- Add points for spins and rolls.
- Make speed responsive based on crashing and smooth landings.
### Day 3
- Add styling and animation to sprites.
- Add sounds based.
- Style background, ocean and sky.
- Create instructions page.
